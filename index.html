      <h3>Modern Subsistence</h3>
      <p>The pursuits of existence have traditionally been segmented into two main categories, namely those of needs and wants.
      Needs are defined as that which is required for basic survival.
      Food, clothing, and shelter are the established base of the needs pyramid, but these needs have manifested themselves differently over the generations.
      </p>
      <p>The ancient farmers' needs involved more complexity than that of there wandering nomadic counterparts,
      although there needs were techincally the same.
      Technology, particulary industrialized and digital technologies, cause this complexity to increase further and in many ways define the modern civilizations we exist in today.
      These modern civilizations have luxuries and excess at larger scales than ever before.
      This excess is a natural manifestation of what the People want and changes with each generation.
      </p>
      <p>As the scale and complexity of modern digital civilizations increases so does the needs and wants of the People.
      The same technologies that have lead to vast amounts of innovation, have also created an exacerbated bifurcation of the People.
      The wants of a few now grossly outweigh the needs of the many.
      Our opinions are polarized by the spreading of cheap information masquarading as knowledge.
      This modern way of thinking keeps us from making real progress.
      We can achieve great amounts of innovation, yet People still starve in the world.
      Our undirected awareness inhibits the progress of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
      Modern subsistence is the idea that food, clothing and shelter are fundamental to existence, but recognizes that in the digital age unprecedented access to information
      molds our perception of needs in a way which is challenging to the individual.
      The increased general level of overall awareness (in large part caused by the spread of information through internet technologies today and the printing press before that) has left many to recognize that free access to education, healthcare and information are fundamental rights.
      </p>
      <p>The practical manifestation of needs and wants in societies occurs in marketplaces.
      Grocery stores, social media sites, stock exchanges, etc. all serve as places of exchange.
      These marketplaces are driven by supply and demand and result in the creation of our perceptions of value.
      This value drives innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
      Although this system produces vast amounts of innovation it is incapable of addressing the fundamental rights and basic needs of modern subsistence for all.
      It is overwhelmy driven by fierce competition and some cannot compete given the nature of the requirements to enter these markets.
      Although not everyone can compete at the top level, this does not make the system unfair.
      But fair and just are two separate things.
      We need ways to help those who need help and incentivize the already enabled to join in the effort.
      </p>
      <p>PnL is working to build an auxillary system to run alongside our current one with the goal of providing modern subsistence for everyone.
      Free and Open Source Solutions are leveraged to provide no cost modern subsistence through a system managed by the People and for the People.
      Where physical goods are required (food production, medicine, shelter, computers, etc.) financing mechanisms are being developed to allow for tax free donations from modern system participants.
      These donations are invested by our expert financial consultants to provide a sustainable mechanism of physical goods delivery for free to all People.
      We are technologists at heart and believe FOSS should be applied to more than just software.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our goal is simple: End World Hunger of the Body, Mind, and Soul.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Feed the Body</h3>
      <p>The growing of food was once the main mechanism of survival for almost every Person.
      Economies of scale in the agricultural industry lead to many small farmers closing down or being forced to sell.
      This mass centralized food production leads to enormous waste as food is spoiled in delivery to remote regions, 
      Farmers overwork the land to produce large amounts of food at a cheap cost, but these practices are shown to be unsustainable and produce lower quality food.
      Plants can be grown quickly or accurately, but not both.
      This low cost, low quality food, although filling is not nutrious and therefore requires expensive suppliments to be consumed in ones diet in order to be healthy.
      Healthy nutrious food options should not be a luxury, but rather a gurantee as a part of ones basic needs.
      </p>
      <p>PnL is working with local farming organizations to educate People about the benefits of healthy living and provide free locally grown food to communities.
      Our goal is to work towards allowing all individuals who are in need to recieve household small scale farming units to provide free nutrious food farmed as close to the consumer as possible.
      As some produce is not feasible to grow in ones home, community gardens are essential to the goals of healthy food.

      <h3>Nourish the Mind</h3>
      <p>
      Education is essential to the growth of individuals.
      Today in many places education paths involve some form of primary school followed by higher levels of education or in some cases trade schools.
      The goals of these institutions is aimed at fostering problem solving skills and career progression.
      Many primary schools are underfunded and higher level education is often prohibitively expensive.
      The quality of these educations is often poor as students are disengaged.
      The link between their schooling and practical life is lacking.
      Simply making higher level education free of cost does not remove the other problems of the modern education system.
      </p>
      <p>
      PnL is working to provide practical community supported learning paths around literacy, computer skills, and personal finance.
      These learning paths are supported by information currated for free by experts around the web.
      Community supported education that never stops.

      <h3>Replenish the Soul</h3>
        <p>
         To create is to exist with purpose.
         As modern subsistence becomes viable for all, the driving motivation will be that of creation.
         Art captures the essence of life.
         Music is a univeral experience.
         Modern technology has enabled massive amounts of content creation.
         Today only some are able to monetize and live sustainably from there creations.
	</p>
        <p>PnL aims to build a system which provides the basic needs of the People, so we can focus on doing what we love.
        Building our own creations and experiencing what others decide to uniquely create.
        </p>
      <h3>Free and Open Source Solutions (FOSS)</h3>
      <p>
       The best things in life are free, else noone could afford them.
       PnL is dedicated to supporting free and open source projects to give end users a choice when it comes to the technologies they use today.
       As many of these technologies are currently serving only experieced technical users, our goal is remove the barrier to entry by simplifying deployments
       and promoting the crowd configuration of many popular tools such as Mattermost, JitsiMeet, GitLab, Wireguard and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The PnL CLI is a tool to deploy terraform configured applications on your cloud provider of choice.
       The current focus is on getting everyone access to secure Virtual Private Networks or VPNs.
       VPNs protect users on unsecured WiFi networks and are resistant to censorship.
       Information should be accessible by all.
       We all should be free to speak our minds.
