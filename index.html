      <p>PnL is creating free and open source solutions to make modern subsistence available to everyone.</p>
      <br /><br />

      <h3>Modern Subsistence</h3>
      <p> Food, water, clothing, and shelter are limited resources that are required for individuals to survive.
      <p>Although we have made great advances in technology, these basic needs are still not guranteed to everyone today.
      Healthcare and education are institutions designed to advance the mind and maintain the well being of the People.
      Although modern socities acknowledge the need for these systems, they come at a cost.
      Today this cost limits its access.
      </p>
      <p>
      Modern subsistence is the idea that in addition to faciliting our basic needs, the main function of society is to provide education and health services to all who desire it.
      </p> 
      <h3>Free and Open Source Solutions</h3>
      <p>By reimaging education, healthcare, finance, technology and food security we are starting to transform our communities by working towards a common goal in a new way.</p>
